## About

I'm a self taught programming enthusiast who loves to code and build applications.
Although I did my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, I have found my passion in coding.
I like to solve problem using coding which is great fun. I have solved around 90+ problems in CodeForces using C and C++.
Currently I'm specializing on Javascript particularly on MERN stack. Other than these, I'm also focusing on Mysql for relational database.
